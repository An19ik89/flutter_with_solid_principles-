We'll assume you're the high-level module and the bank is the low-level module.\n\nBut what happens when the bank is closed for a holiday or an emergency? You have absolutely no access to your funds. If you move further away from the bank, it becomes a bigger problem because you'd spend more time getting there.\n\nTo solve this problem, an interface is introduced â€“ an automated teller machine (ATM) or a mobile banking app. Even though you have a relationship with the bank, you are no longer required to interact with them physically to be served.\n\nThis example is similar to the dependency inversion principle.
